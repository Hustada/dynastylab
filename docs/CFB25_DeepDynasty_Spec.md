## üéôÔ∏è Step 3: Commentary Prompts for Deep Story

Write a 10-year dynasty recap for Nebraska. They won 3 conference titles, lost in a playoff semifinal, and had 2 Heisman finalists. Include ups and downs, coaching changes, and how the team is viewed nationally now.
```

### Coach Legacy

## üíæ Step 4: Persistence & State

- Save each `Season`, `TeamStats`, `Coach`, and `TeamHistory` object in localStorage via Zustand or Context
- Optionally export JSON bundles for backup:
  - `dynasty-seasons.json`
  - `team-history.json`
  - `coach-records.json`

---

## ‚úÖ Final Tips

- Claude can help generate mock data from real stats or summaries
- Use `Timeline.tsx` to link all narrative-worthy events together
- Show charts or decade summaries in `LegacyDashboard`

---

Once this is implemented, you‚Äôll have a system that gives you:
- Story-driven immersion
- ESPN-style commentary
- Historical depth
- Full user control of the dynasty universe
